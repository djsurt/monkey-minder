	abstract = {Federated learning is a distributed deep learning method that trains models without sending local private training data to a server, achieving communication efficiency and security. However, current federated learning techniques have two key issues: 1) scalability limitations due to heavy traffic concentrated on the central server and 2) performance degradation caused by systems and data heterogeneity. To address these issues, we propose P2P-Fed, a decentralized federated learning approach with asynchronous aggregation to minimize delays and enhance concurrency for faster convergence. We adopt Chord, a popular distributed hash table protocol, to reduce the load on individual nodes in large-scale environments and ensure stable performance in high-churn networks. We designed and implemented this system to run in a real distributed environment. Experiments in various realistic scenarios demonstrated that P2P-Fed achieved up to a 6.9\% performance improvement compared to the best-performing baseline algorithm, without incurring additional overhead.},

	abstract = {According to a recent article published by Forbes, the use of enterprise blockchain applications by companies is expanding. Private blockchain, such as enterprise blockchain, usually uses the Raft algorithm to achieve a consensus. However, the Raft algorithm can cause network split in unstable networks. When a network applying Raft split, the {TPS}(Transactions Per Second) is decreased, which results in decreased performance for the entire blockchain system. To reduce the probability of network split, we select a more stable node as the next leader. To select a better leader, we propose three criteria and suggest exploiting federated learning to evaluate them for network stability. As a result, we show that blockchain consensus performance is improved by lowering the probability of network split.},

	abstract = {Emerging edge and {IoT} networks are characterized by churn, wherein nodes join, leave, and fail continuously. Together with flaky network links and delays in edge and {IoT} systems, this means nodes have differing views of the system membership at any point of time. This paper focuses on the classical mutual exclusion problem—which ensures at most one node executes the “critical section” at any point in time—over such churned edge networks. We first show that two classical algorithms for mutual exclusion (Ricart-Agrawala and Maekawa) violate safety even under very small amounts of churn (up to 4 churned entries in membership lists). We then present Camera, a churn-tolerant variant of Ricart-Agrawala's algorithm. We formally prove Camera satisfies key properties including safety, deadlock-freedom, and starvation-freedom. Our trace-driven simulation results, using synthetic traces, distributions, and churn traces from peer to peer environments, show that Camera has scalable wait times and bandwidth overheads.},

	abstract = {Consensus algorithm is widely used in distributed system, which can solve the problems of fault tolerance and data consistency. Raft algorithm is one of the most widely used consensus algorithms to maintain consensus and fault tolerance in some distributed systems. However, the original Raft algorithm may fail to consider the problems of recovering the logs of all servers from failures as well as the increase number of logs under failures such as node downtime and unreliable networks. To this end, we propose an optimized Raft algorithm based on Snapshot technology, called Snapshot Raft ({SS}-Raft). Snapshot is one of the methods of log compression. When consensus is reached, the {SS}-Raft algorithm can exploit the snapshot technique to compress the number of entries submitted to the log. The experimental results illustrate that the number of log entries submitted by the server decrease significantly under unreliable network and churn failures, which will effectively reduce the storage space of nodes and greatly improve the system performance. In addition, the {SS}-Raft algorithm can also operate normally under a variety of failure environments and improve the performance of distributed systems.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the distributed systems have been widely applied in a variety of fields. However, this raises more concerns on reliability. Consensus algorithm is an important measure to ensure reliability of distributed systems, but its strong consistency may reduce the performance, resulting in cluster failure or even downtime. To this end, we propose an accelerated log backtracking optimization Raft algorithm, called {ALB}-Raft. It can improve the performance of traditional raft algorithm by enabling the backward tracker to update quickly. In particular, to achieve strong consistency, we construct a fault-tolerant distributed key-value ({KV}) service which conforms to the linearizable semantics. The experimental results illustrate that, when compared to the traditional raft algorithm, the proposed {ALB}-Raft consensus algorithm can resolve 20\% of hundreds of log entry conflicts. Moreover, the {ALB}-Raft algorithm can also avoid the linear increase in the number of messages with the aggravation of log conflicts to ensure strong consistency.},

	abstract = {Leader election is a classical problem in distributed systems in which the selection a coordinator node to perform tasks is necessary. However, coordinator can fail and this requires performing a leader election operation to choose a new coordinator. This study focuses on the Bully algorithm which uses a lot of messages and higher network traffic which are considered the main drawback. This paper provides a simple and adaptable adaptive bully algorithm that lowers the messages passing used and is simple and flexible. The algorithm utilizes only one node, called responsibility for the election, and a time span, where a time span is set for each node. These two procedures minimize leader election operations especially discovering failures from multiple processes in the system and messages passing. According to the results, the enhanced algorithm is better than the algorithm bully. It reduces the complexity of message passing during leader election operations.},

	abstract = {{ZooKeeper} masks crash failure of servers to provide a highly available, distributed coordination kernel; however, in production, not all failures are crash failures. Bugs in underlying software systems and hardware can corrupt the {ZooKeeper} replicas, leading to data loss. Since {ZooKeeper} is used as a 'source of truth' for mission-critical applications, it essential to detect data inconsistencies caused by arbitrary faults to safeguard reliability. Byzantine Fault Tolerance ({BFT}) promises to handle these problems. However, these protocols are expensive in important dimensions: development, deployment, complexity, and performance. {ZooKeeper} takes an alternative approach that focuses on detecting faulty behavior rather than tolerating it and thus providing improved reliability without paying the full expense of {BFT} protocols.
This paper describes various techniques used for detecting data inconsistencies in {ZooKeeper}. We also analyzed the impact of using these techniques on the reliability and performance of the overall system. Our evaluation shows that a real-time digest-based fault detection technique can be employed in production to provide improved reliability with a minimal performance penalty and no additional operational cost. We hope that our analysis and evaluation can help guide the design of next-generation primary-backup systems aiming to provide high reliability.},

	abstract = {Atomic broadcast is one of the fundamental synchronization primitives for organizing shared state (consensus) in distributed systems. The promising way for implementing atomic broadcast is decentralized approach, which does not involve leader election procedure. Such approach distributes the workload uniformly among the processes, allows robustness and supports large-scale systems. Currently, there are no algorithms for atomic broadcast in actor model, which is one of the most actively developing and is widely used today. In this work, we design decentralized algorithm of atomic broadcast in the actor model. In contract to message passing model ({MPI}) actor model implements dynamical mapping of active entity (actor) to the threads and processes of operating system. High-level actor model allows to use developed tools for wide range of distributed applications. We have done experiments on computer cluster. The obtained latency for atomic broadcast was less than 10 ms for the subsystem of 20 nodes and broadcasting 20 requests of 100 bytes per second. In this paper, we describe the developed algorithm and the scheme for resolving system failures. The algorithm is implemented as a software library and may be used for fault-tolerant computing in distributed computer systems, for example, for implementing data replication.},

In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos.
