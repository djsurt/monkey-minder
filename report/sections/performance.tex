For performance, we devise a simple demonstration, running a cluster of $N$ nodes, then connecting to them with $100$ clients (evenly distributed which connects to which node), and having each client run $1000$ reads.
Under this workload, increasing the cluster size from $3$ to $10$ results in a 30 percent speed improvement.

This would be in contrast to a similar system not relaxing Raft's guarantees for reads, they would not have any improvement in time as all reads would need to be forwarded to and handled by the leader.
