ZooKeeper achieves consensus through the ZooKeeper Atomic Broadcast (Zab)
protocol, which is a leader-based atomic broadcast system designed to ensure
consistent state replication across nodes [1]. Zab shares some conceptual similarities
with the Raft algorithm, such as leader election and log replication, but was developed
independently [3]. Since Raft has become widely adopted and is designed to be
understandable, we will elect to use Raft to provide both leader election and
consistency in our implementation.
Much research has been done to improve the performance and consistency of Raft
under failure scenarios. For instance, in [4] Kim et al. explored improving leader-based
consensus algorithms such as Raft using federated learning to enhance stability and
performance. Furthermore, Liu et. al has suggested improvements in both performance
and strict consistency guarantees over the original Raft algorithm by requiring strong
consistency of followers logs [5]. They show that their accelerated log backtracking Raft
algorithm can reduce the number of RPCs required to resolve log conflicts under
multiple leader election failure scenarios [5]. Similarly, Liu et Al. (2023) propose an
optimized Raft algorithm (SS-Raft) that incorporates snapshot-based log compression
to reduce excessive log growth during replication and improve recovery under unreliable
networks and churn failures [6]. Finally, Paznikov et. al proposes a leaderless approach
to atomic broadcast using the actor model of concurrency [7]; while the actor model
approach is appealing to us, we think designing a ZooKeeper service around the actor
model is a more appropriate topic for subsequent research projects.
Building on these ideas, our project will use Raft atomic broadcast to achieve strong
consistency among replicas. In particular, we draw inspiration from recent research
such as [8], which demonstrates that atomic broadcast can be achieved efficiently
through a reduction from multivalued Byzantine Agreement (MBA) while avoiding heavy
cryptographic signatures, and from [9] S. Mane et. al which proposes additions to
ZooKeeper which give it better resilience against Byzantine faults.
